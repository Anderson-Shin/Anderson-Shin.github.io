## What am I studying?

As a junior student at the University of Hong Kong, pursuing a major in Risk Management and a minor in Finance, I am actively engaged in studying the intricate domain of financial risks and uncertainties. This academic pursuit equips me with the requisite knowledge and skills to proficiently identify, assess, and mitigate risks, ensuring the safeguarding of assets, investments, and businesses against potential losses. Given the paramount significance of effective risk management in the real finance world, I recognize its pivotal role in capital preservation, financial stability, and informed decision-making.


## Why study data analysis?

In addition to honing risk management techniques, I am presently undertaking self-directed studies in the field of data science. Effective risk management is a cornerstone of the finance industry. Data analysis allows for the identification and quantification of risks, enabling professionals to develop risk management strategies and mitigation plans. By analyzing historical data, market trends, and correlations, finance professionals can assess and manage various types of risk, such as market risk, credit risk, operational risk, and liquidity risk. This endeavor aims to enhance my ability to handle extensive datasets and effectively visualize them for the purpose of executing projects or presenting comprehensive reports.

## Overall, my aim for this blog is...

I am deeply motivated to apply the knowledge and skills I have acquired during my undergraduate studies to real-world situations. With a strong desire to bridge the gap between academic learning and practical application, I am wholeheartedly committed to utilizing my expertise in various projects and endeavors. My ultimate goal is to make a meaningful and tangible impact by effectively applying the skills and knowledge gained during my university education.
