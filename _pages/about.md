As a junior student at the University of Hong Kong, pursuing a major in Risk Management and a minor in Finance, I am actively engaged in studying the intricate domain of financial risks and uncertainties. This academic pursuit equips me with the requisite knowledge and skills to proficiently identify, assess, and mitigate risks, ensuring the safeguarding of assets, investments, and businesses against potential losses. Given the paramount significance of effective risk management in the real finance world, I recognize its pivotal role in capital preservation, financial stability, and informed decision-making. In addition to honing risk management techniques, I am presently undertaking self-directed studies in the field of data science. This endeavor aims to enhance my ability to handle extensive datasets and effectively visualize them for the purpose of executing projects or presenting comprehensive reports.
