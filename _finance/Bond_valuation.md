# Valuation of Bond Price

## Bond price calculation

$F$ = Face value, $c$ = Coupon rate in semi-annual payment, $T$ = remaining years of maturity

let $i$ be the yield to maturity (yield rate , market interest), and $P$ be the bond price.

$P = (\sum_{t=1}^{2T}F\times\frac{c}{2}\times \frac{1}{(1+\frac{i}{2})^t}) + \frac{F}{(1+\frac{i}{2})^{2T}}$

→ $P =(F\times\frac{c}{2}) \sum_{t=1}^{2T}\frac{1}{(1+\frac{i}{2})^t}+\frac{F}{(1+\frac{i}{2})^{2T}}$ →$P =(F\times\frac{c}{2})\times \frac{1-\frac{1}{(1+\frac{i}{2})^{2T}}}{\frac{i}{2}} +F\times \frac{1}{(1+\frac{i}{2})^{2T}}$

given above setting where bond is redeemed at its face value, yield rate = coupon rate. 
below is the constructed table to visualize the idea using formula.

$$
P = (\sum_{t=1}^{2T}F\times\frac{c}{2}\times \frac{1}{(1+\frac{i}{2})^t}) + \frac{F}{(1+\frac{i}{2})^{2T}}
$$

If we set the different values of yield rate given the same condition as table above(maturity of 8years, coupon rate of 4%, Face value of 1) we can achieve the trend of yield rate and value of bond as below

By looking at the graph we can clearly see the inverse relationship between yield rate and bond value at time(t).
