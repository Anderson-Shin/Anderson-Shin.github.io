# Marginal analysis

- **Focus:** Compares **additional benefits** (marginal benefit) with **additional costs** (marginal cost) of an activity.
- **Goal:** Determine the optimal level of an activity to maximize net benefit.
- **Key concepts:**
    - **Marginal benefit:** Increase in total benefit from one more unit of something.
    - **Marginal cost:** Increase in total cost from one more unit of something.
    - **Optimum point:** Where marginal benefit equals marginal cost.
- **Applications:**
    - Businesses: Pricing, production levels, inventory management.
    - Individuals: Budgeting, investment decisions, time allocation.
    - Economics: Resource allocation, market efficiency.
- **Limitations:**
    - Assumes diminishing marginal returns: benefits/costs decrease with each additional unit. (It is going to be discussed on later posts)
    - Ignores fixed costs and other factors.
    - Can be complex to apply in real-world scenarios.

**Bonus:**

- Marginal analysis involves a "step-by-step" approach, considering each additional unit separately.
- It's a powerful tool for informed decision-making but should be used alongside other considerations.

**Example**

| no. of orange | Total benefit | Total cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | $0 | $0 |
| 1 | $20 | $3 |
| 2 | $30 | $6 |
| 3 | $32 | $9 |
| 4 | $27 | $12 |

| no. of orange | Additional benefit | Additional cost | Eat or not |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | $20 | $3 | yes |
| 2 | $10 | $3 | yes |
| 3 | $2 | $3 | no |
| 4 | -$5 | $3 | no |

The table above shows that additional benefit tends to drop from 3rd orange and beyond. Therefore, eating until 2nd orange is worth it.

Marginal benefit is the additional benefit generated by moving from one feasible alternative to the next.

Marginal cost is the additional cost generated by moving from one feasible alternative to the next. —> It always contains opportunity cost.

Optimization of marginal analysis follows: 

1. Yes if MB≥MC
2. NO if MB≤MC
3. Usually assume yes of MB = MC

## Net benefit analysis = total benefit - total cost

1. Translate all costs and benefits into common unit
2. Calculate the net benefit of each alternative
3. Choose highest net benefit

| no. of orange | Total benefit | Total cost | Net benefit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| 1 | $20 | $3 | $17 |
| 2 | $30 | $6 | $24 |
| 3 | $32 | $9 | $23 |
| 4 | $27 | $12 | $15 |

## Production Possibilities Frontier

It shows Maximum attainable combinations of two goods that can be produced using Existing resources and Best available technology.

On the PPF Boundary → Producing efficiently since all existing resources with best available Technology ( G,I)

Inside the PPF Boundary → Producing Inefficiently

Outside the PPF Boundary → unattainable to produce

Shift of the PPF occurs when **Production Possibilities** are affected by the change in constraints.
