## Demand

Law of demand → The Higher the price of the good, the smaller the quantity demanded.

P increased : move up along D curve → less Qd, P decreased : move down along the D curve → greater Qd

## Supply

Law of Supply → The Higher the price of a good, the more significant the quantity supplied

P increased: move up along the S curve → Greater Qs, P decreased: move down along the S curve → less Qs.

## Equilibrium

If, $Q_s>Q_d$, it indicates excess supply, which results in a surplus, and surplus drives the price down.

If $Q_s>Q_d$, it indicates excess demand, which results in shortage, and shortage drives prices up.

Market equilibrium is when $Q_s = Q_d$

When either Demand or Supply is at a constant level, there is a determinate change in Price and Quantity of equilibrium.

When there are changes in both Demand and Supply, there is always an indeterminate change in the Price and Quantity of the equilibrium.
