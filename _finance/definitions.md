## Definition

Scarcity = unlimited wants > limited resources 

Economics = study of allocating scarce resources and predict the effect of choices to the society

Optimization = Best feasible option with given constraints and process involves trade-offs

1. Marginal analysis → Marginal Benefit -Marginal Cost 
2. Net benefit analysis → Total benefit -Total cost

Equilibrium = Situation of simultaneous optimization (nobody would benefit personally by changing behavior, given the choices of others)

- Equilibrium price indicates the agreed price when quantity demanded equals quantity supplied
- Equilibrium quantity indicates the quantity bought and sold at the equilibrium price

Capital = manufactured goods that are used to produce other goods and services; Physical capital + Financial capital

**Entrepreneurship** = someone who brings the factors of production — land, labour, capital etc. to produce goods and services and earn profits 

**Benefit** = gain or pleasure that is determined by preferences

**Cost** = factor to give up to gain something

**Trade-offs** = Event occurred when some benefits are given up in order to gain something

**Opportunity cost** = Highest valued alternative that must be given up to gain something. 

**normal goods** = which results in increase in demand due to an increase in a consumer’s income

**inferior goods** = which results in decrease in demand due to an increase in a consumer’s income

**substitute goods** = product that can be used as a replacement for another product

**complements goods** = two or more goods typically consumed together, such that change in price or availability of one good affects the demand for the tother good

**Price ceiling** = regulation that makes it illegal to charge a price higher than specific level

**Price floor** = regulation that makes it illegal to trade at a price lower than a specific level.

**GDP (Gross Domestic Product)** = market value of all final goods and services produced in a country during a period of time, typically one year and **remember the term GDP takes within the country**

**Efficiency of economics**

- **Productive efficiency** : goods and services are produced at the lowest possible cost
- **Allocative efficiency** : Production is consistent with consumers’ preferences : Marginal benefit of production = marginal cost
- aforementioned efficiency results from **voluntary exchange** where transactions that make both buyer and seller better off.
